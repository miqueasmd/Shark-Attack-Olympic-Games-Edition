Shark Attack Analysis: Insurance Packages Based on Data Insights

Group: Benjamín Mancera, Irene Gauna, Clara Gallego, Miqueas Molina & Laura Sánchez

🦈 Project Overview
Welcome to the Shark Attack Analysis project! In this collaborative effort, our team has cleaned and analyzed a comprehensive database on shark attacks. Our objective? To simulate how an insurance company might assess risk and create various pricing packages based on statistical insights and hypotheses derived from the data.

🔍 Hypotheses Explored
During our analysis, we examined several key hypotheses regarding shark attacks:

Youth Vulnerability: Are younger individuals more prone to shark attacks?
Gender Disparities: Is there a higher incidence of attacks among men compared to women?
Historical Gender Trends: Did men historically face more fatal attacks, possibly due to higher participation in riskier sports?
Unprovoked Attacks: What percentage of attacks are unprovoked?
Geographical Risks: Are coastal areas more susceptible to shark attacks?
Climate Influence: Do warmer states experience a higher frequency of attacks?
Surfing Risks: Are surfers more likely to be attacked by sharks?
Severity of Attacks: Are white sharks associated with more severe injuries or fatalities?


📊 Data Cleaning and Analysis
Our team employed various data cleaning techniques to ensure the integrity and reliability of our dataset. Afterward, we conducted a thorough analysis to validate our hypotheses. The insights gained will help us determine how to structure insurance packages effectively.

🛠 Tools and Technologies Used
Python: For data analysis and manipulation.
Pandas: To manage and clean the dataset.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

💡 Key Findings
Youth Vulnerability: Younger demographics show a significant correlation with increased shark attacks.
Gender Trends: Men are indeed more likely to be attacked than women, reflecting historical participation in aquatic activities.
Coastal Zones: A clear trend indicates that attacks are more prevalent in coastal areas, particularly in warmer climates.
Surfing: Surfers represent a high-risk group for shark encounters.
📈 Insurance Package Recommendations
Based on our analysis, we propose the following insurance packages tailored to risk profiles:

Youth Package: Designed for young individuals engaging in aquatic activities.
Male Activity Package: Higher premiums for males participating in riskier sports.
Coastal Coverage: Enhanced coverage in coastal areas.
Surfer’s Shield: Comprehensive insurance for surfers, considering their higher attack rates.
